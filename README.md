### Project Description
My projecct is a wiper for bike helmets, such that the user can drive effortlessly without getting their helmet glass wet.

Helmet gets drenched too in the rain and driving becomes hard!!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Well, made a wiper that detects rain and wipes away water automatically.

*The final build works with the servo being at the right angle such that it stays in front of the visor when raining and when resting it moves up not to destruct the vision of the rider.*

*It demonstratres the working of my Helmet-Wiper, where when raining, it automatically turns on the wiper and wipes away the rainwater, with no need of turning on manually*
